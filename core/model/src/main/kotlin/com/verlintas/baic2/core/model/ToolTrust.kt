/**
 * Prompt-injection bookkeeping. Text from outside the user (web pages, RSS,
 * notifications, OCR, transcription) is data, never instructions. The marker
 * travels with the content:
 *
 * - tool results store it (wrapped before persisting), so the taint survives
 *   across turns and is re-derived from the context window at every run start;
 * - a compression summary that squashes a tainted range keeps the marker, so
 *   laundering through summarisation cannot lift the guard;
 * - a sub-agent report that touched untrusted content is wrapped on the way
 *   back up, and a tainted parent spawns a tainted child.
 *
 * Taint never blocks by itself: it downgrades HIGH-danger calls to explicit
 * confirmation (and unattended runs already refuse them outright).
